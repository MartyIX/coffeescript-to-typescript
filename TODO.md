[X] sourcemaped error support for coffee-typer (debugging blind at the moment)

[X] class definitions
  [X] method: -> ...    --> method() { ... }
  [X] member: value     --> public member = value
  [X] @member: value    --> (public) static member = value
  [X] @method: -> ...   --> static method() { ... }
  [X] @member = value   --> static member = value
  [X] @method = -> ...  --> static method() { ... }
  [X] warn on everything else
  [X] allow bound methods
  [X] allow block comments
  [X] remove `return`s in constructor
  [X] explicit `public` on methods, static variables
  [X] add constructor generation where needed for bound methods

[X] method definitions
  [X] constructors (CS&TS treat them the same, just make them normal mehtods)
  [X] `public` parameters for constructors
  [X] static methods
  [X] `this` refers to the class object in static methods...?

[X] super (only calls current method on immediate super)
  [-] w/o arg: applies current args (not used in target codebase)
  [X] super in static methods work... but they shouldn't

[X] function definitions
  [X] default parameters
  [-] overloads (not in CoffeeScript; code that uses parameters as different types will need to be rewritten)
  [X] varargs (splats -> spreads, args... -> ...args)
  [X] pull out if in Assign

[X] fat/thin arrow lambdas
  [X] always use TS lambda on bound functions
  [-] use TS lambda where `this` is not used    (too much work vs using regular anon-funcs)
  [X] `() => {return exp;}`  --> `() => exp`    (on single expressions)

[X] for loop / comprehensions
  [X] .filter()                   where there is a guard
  [X] .map()                      where results matter
  [X] .forEach()                  where results don't matter
  [-] unbox elements in lambdas   where pattern matching is used  (used 8 times in target codebase)
  [X] use default generation      where for elem, index in list
  [X] use default generation      where for key, val of object
  [X] use default generation      where for elem(, index) in list by step

[X] modules
  [X] imports
  [X] export =
  [X] smart exports

[X] make __bind _.bind (using underscore)
[X] remove extra semicolon after top-level function and class definitions   (isStatement: YES)
[X] remove `Generated by CoffeeScript` header

[-] stop predeclaring variables; declare at first usage if possible (apparently this is a best practice)

[-] :: (prototype extension...) this just happens, see what tsc has to say about it

[X] @warn: log message, line of code, line numbers
[X] @nogen
[X] pattern match nodes

[-] do construct (only used 3 times in target code base)

[X] TypeScript requrires members to be declared
  [X] read tsc's errors to find undeclared members... maybe this should be a separate tool...
  [X] tsc doesn't try to guess the types of the members... for now maybe we should just use public

[ ] fakeblock
[X] use _.range for [1..10]
[ ] use => lambdas where just [return @(nothis)]
[ ] if a line is a series of properties (.attr("", =>)*), break up into several lines w/ indentation
[X] add `import _ = require('underscore')` if it doesn't already exist

[ ] end-to-end CoffeeScript vs TypeScript output tests
[X] bin/coffee should print stack trace on internal exception
[X] bin/coffee should skip to compiling the next file on exception from the current one

FIXABLE BUGS:
[X] in `=> {k: v*}`, use `=> ({k: v*})` or tsc will think the braces denote a block
[X] hanlde exporting Arr like exporting arbitrary expr
[ ] TPA does, in fact, need to handle classes with the same name, and possibly renamed
[ ] in `class C then p = v`, p may be used as static and may be used as nonstatic (lineAnnotation.ts:162)
[X] `private static constructor(){` (lineAnnotation.ts:149)
[ ] in generated constructor, super() should be first, not last (lineAnnotation.ts:153)
[ ] remove unused variables, particularly _ref type stuff (_j, _len1 on lineAnnotation.ts:325)
[ ] I don't think TPA considers static variables
[ ] .forEach() lambdas need to have their variables declared in the enclosing scope
